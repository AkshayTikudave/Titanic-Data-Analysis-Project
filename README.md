# Titanic-Data-Analysis-Project


• I have done Data Analysis of Titanic passenger. 

• Used libraries numpy , pandas , matplotlib , seaborn for data visualization. 

• Understand was there any influence of age, pclass , embarked on survival rate of passenger. 


1. Survival Analysis: Performed a detailed analysis of Titanic survival data to identify key factors that influenced survival rates, such as gender, passenger class, and embarkation point.
   
2. Data Visualization: Utilized Python libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib to create visual representations of survival distributions based on various features, providing clear insights into the dataset.
   
3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Applied data preprocessing techniques, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables, to prepare the dataset for analysis and modeling.
   
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to uncover correlations and trends within the dataset, such as the impact of ticket class and family size on survival outcomes.
